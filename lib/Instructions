# 🛠️ Employee Login System - Instructions Page (VS Code)

Welcome! This document will guide you step-by-step on how to run the **Java + MySQL Employee Login System** using **VS Code** and **DBeaver**.

---

## ✅ Requirements
- MySQL Server (running on `localhost:3306`)
- DBeaver (for managing database)
- Java JDK
- VS Code (with Java extensions installed)
- `mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar` placed in a `lib/` folder in the project

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Set Up the Database

1. Open DBeaver and connect to MySQL.
2. Create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE employeeData;
   ```
3. Open and run the full SQL file provided (tables + inserts).
   - This creates and populates:
     - `users`
     - `employees`
     - `payroll`
     - `division`
     - `employee_division`
     - `job_titles`
     - `employee_job_titles`

> ✅ NOTE: All employee data is cleaned — no duplicates or unused entries like "Emma Johnson".

## 👥 Step 2: Login Credentials

### Admin:
- **Username**: `admin1`
- **Password**: `adminpass`

### Employee:
- **Username**: `emp1`
- **Password**: `emppass`

Employee accounts fetch details by matching `username@example.com` in the `employees.email` column.

---

## 💻 Step 3: Run the Java Program in VS Code

1. Open your Java project folder in VS Code.
2. Confirm the structure:
   ```plaintext
   Software Dev project/
   ├── lib/
   │   └── mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar
   ├── Main.java
   └── Instructions
   ```
3. Compile and run from Terminal:
   ```bash
   javac -cp ".:lib/mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar" Main.java
   java -cp ".:lib/mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar" Main
   ```

## 🔐 Admin Functionality

### View Options:
Admins are prompted:
```
Do you want to:
1. View all employees
2. Search by name
3. Search by HireDate
4. Search by SSN
5. Search by empid
6. Filter by department
7. Filter by job title
```
- Partial match allowed for names.
- Exact match required for SSN and empid.

### Admin Privileges:
- Can view **all fields**: `HireDate`, `Salary`, `SSN`, etc.
- Can **edit** salary, department, job title.
- **Cannot edit** SSN or empid.
- Can use full SQL commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Admins will be asked:
  ```
  Do you want to update any employee information? (y/n)
  If yes → Prompt for SSN or empid
  Then → Show update menu (salary, job title, division)
  ```

## 👤 Employee View
```
Enter username: emp1
Enter password: emppass
✅ Login successful. Role: employee
👤 Welcome Employee. Fetching your data...
Name: Snoopy Beagle
Employee ID: 1
Email: Snoopy@example.com
HireDate: 2022-08-01
Salary: $45,000.00
```

Employees can **only see** their own data.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- **Login failed** → Check `users` table.
- **No record found** → Ensure matching email exists.
- **SQL error** → Confirm `USE employeeData;` and proper table setup.
